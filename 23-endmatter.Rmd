## Comments on the "Check your understanding" exercises

### Chapter 1

1.  *We are measuring people's weight, but the scales are incorrectly calibrated, so the true measurement is always underestimated*

    **Comment**: this is a systematic bias, because the defective scales lead to a bias in one direction. Note that scales that overestimated weight would also give systematic bias, whereas scales that were just erratic, and so gave very unstable readings, would be a source of random error.

2.  *To get an index of social responsiveness, children's interactions with others are measured in the classroom. The researcher makes one observation per child, with different children assessed at different times of day during different activities.*

    **Comment**: this method is likely to create random error, because social interaction may be greater with some activities than others. Another way to think about it, is that the measure will be 'noisier', i.e. more variable, than it would be if the researcher was able to keep the context of the observations more constant from child to child.

3.  *In an online experiment where we measure children's keypress responses on a comprehension test, the internet connection is poor and so drops out intermittently*

    **Comment**: This is another context that will just increase the random error in the measures, but should not cause systematic bias towards fast or slow measures, provided the drop-out is random. On the other hand, if we were measuring children's comprehension before and after intervention, and the signal dropout was only a problem during one of the test sessions, then this could introduce systematic bias, because only one set of measures (baseline or outcome) would be affected.

4.  *In an intervention study with aphasic individuals, prior to treatment, vocabulary is measured on a naming test by a therapist in the clinic, and at follow-up it is measured at home by a carer who gives clues to the correct answer.*

    **Comment**: This method is likely to produce systematic bias, because the conditions are more likely to lead to correct performance in the follow-up session. This could give an artificially inflated estimate of the effectiveness of intervention. In general, it is advisable to keep testing conditions as similar as possible for baseline and outcome measures. Note, though, that even if we used identical procedures at baseline and outcome, we might still have systematic bias associated with to the passage of time, due to spontaneous recovery and greater familiarity with the naming task. This is considered further in Chapter \@ref(reliability).

### Chapter 2

2.  *The two bars on the left show results obtained in an experimental study where assignment to surgery was done at random, whereas the bars on the right show results from an observational study of patients who were not included in a trial. What do these plots show, and how might it be explained?*

    **Comment**: In Chapter \@ref(RCT), we consider how a randomized trial aims to ensure we are comparing like with like, by assigning people to interventions at random, but there will be people who do not get included in the trial because they are unsuitable, or because they do not wish to take part, and their outcomes may be systematically different from those who take part in the trial. In this example, patients who are at high risk may not be invited to participate in a trial of surgery because they are too frail to undergo the operation. These people feature in the observational study on the right hand side of the plot, but are filtered out of the experimental trial as they do not meet criteria for inclusion.

### Chapter 3

1.  *A simple way to measure children's language development is in term of utterance length. Roger Brown's [@brown1973] classic work showed that in young children Mean Length of Utterance in morphemes (MLU) is a pretty good indicator of a child's language level; this measure counts each part of speech (morpheme) as an element, as well as each word, so the utterance "he wants juice" has 4 morphemes (he + want + s + juice). Brown's findings have stood the test of time, when much larger samples have been assessed. Is this evidence of reliability, validity and/or sensitivity?*

    **Comment**: The plot does not give any information about reliability -- we can only assess that if we have more than one MLU measurement on a set of children, so we can see how much they change from one occasion to the next.  The plot does support the validity of MLU as a measure of language development: we would expect language skills to increase with age, and this plot shows that they do on this measure.  MLU seems to be more sensitive as an index in younger children, where the slope of the increase with age is steeper. Indeed, it has been suggested it is less useful in children aged 4 years and over, though this may depend on whether one is taking spontaneous language samples, or attempting to elicit more complex language -- e.g. in a narrative context. To get a clearer evaluation of the psychometric properties of MLU, we would need to plot not just the changes in mean MLU with age, but also the spread of scores around the mean at each age. If there is a wide range of MLU at a given age band, this suggests the measure may be sensitive at differentiating children with language difficulties from the remainder -- though this would only be the case if the measure was also shown to be reliable.  If MLUs at a given age are all bunched together, then this shows that the measure does not differentiate between children, and it is unlikely to be a sensitive measure for an intervention study.

2.  *Here we focus on **reliability**, i.e., the likelihood that you might see similar results if you did the same assessment on two different occasions. How might you expect the reliability of MLU to depend on:*

    -   *Length of language sample*

    -   *Whether the child is from a clinical or typically-developing sample*

    -   *Whether the language sample comes from an interaction with a caregiver vs an interaction with an unfamiliar person*

    **Comment**: In general, the more data that is used for a measure, the more reliable it is likely to be. Suppose you had just 10 utterances for computing MLU. Then one very long utterance could exert a big impact on the MLU, whereas the effect would be less if the mean were based on 100 utterances. In terms of the nature of the sample, there's no general rule, except to say that if a child from a clinical sample produces fewer utterances, then MLU will be based on fewer observations, so may be less reliable. Similarly, it's hard to predict just how the type of interlocutor will affect a child's utterances. If a child is shy in the presence of an unfamiliar person, it may be harder to get a good sample of utterances, and the MLU may change over time. On the other hand, someone who is skilled at interacting with children may be better at eliciting complex language from a child who would otherwise tend to be monosyllabic. The point here is to emphasize that psychometric properties of measures are not set in stone, but can depend on the context of measurement.

3.  Do a literature search to find out what is known about test-retest reliability of MLU. Did your answers to question 2 agree with the published evidence?

    **Comment**: At the end of Chapter \@ref(pubbias), there is some advice on how to search the literature. If you do not have access to a University Library you may not be able to get hold of all the articles you find, but some will be "open access", which means anyone can download and read them. For those that are not open access, you can request a copy from the author by email: this usually elicits a positive response.

4.  *You have a three-year-old child with a MLU in morphemes of 2.0. Is there enough information in Figure* \@ref(fig:MLU-plot) *to convert this to a standard score?*

    **Comment**: The answer is no, because you only have information on the mean MLU at each age. To compute a standard score you would also need to know the standard deviation at each age.
